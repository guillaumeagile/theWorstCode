# Quick Roadmap to Sucess

## Phase 1: Clarity of Purpose (Persona: everyone)

###Clarity of purpose:

<your component or service>: faster, elegant, usable, useful

### Obsess over our time to value: Innovation
using .Net Core, Angular and open sourced libraries/tools
be able to take advantages of hybrid deployment on Premise + Cloud
aligned with current Microsoft's Cloud Strategy (open source, able to run on Kubernetes)

### Map the users:

<your component or service> is tailored to User's needs and expectations and will be easier to configure, monitor and enhance

## Phase 2: Challenge & Landscape (Persona:  Engineers)
 
 ### Ability to prove that we can deliver value, any time
 - build the first blocks quickly, prepared for production
 - tackle complexity at the very root: 
   - first blocks of <your component or service> should be "view oriented" and read only (Queries first, progressive APIs) 
   - once we have stabilized the Views, we will add more behaviors, more features.
- build the things right, build the right things

### Raising the bar: involve "legacy" developers to build the new parts of the projects, with an affordable learning curve
documented architecture, and reference to industry code standards
auto Documented software (with the help of tools)
apply the best patterns that exists at the time of building (and explain why)
learning hours and online courses will be produced

### Map the org for enablement: Enable empowered engineers.
moving to C# and .Net Core to ease the onboarding of new engineer (as this community is now very large, and this stack is widely adopted)
coding standards at the state of the art, used in others companies
participating (attending and/or speaking) at high grade international meetings and conferences for developers and DevOps engineers


## Phase 3: Next Best Action (Persona: Tech Leaders)
 ###Code is a liability: A serverless-first mindset delivers value.
not tight to technical dependencies or vendors, no more Windows coupling (but running on Windows remains of course possible)
Continuous Integration and Development: CI/CD for real !
DORA metrics unveiled
Sonar metrics always "A rated", permanently minimize the technical debt
security in mind, at any line of code

### Frictionless developer experience: An easy path to production.
simplified use of Git with simpler branch strategy (no more Merge Hell)
design a sustainable, reachable goals: think in terms of MVP (Minimum Viable Parts)
reuse all parts of legacy ICP that will take too much time to rewrite
fast to build, fast to test, fast to deploy
test enabled at any level, from the very beginning : unit test, acceptance tests, integration tests, smoke tests, load tests...
### Map our solution: Align on how we will serve customers
using Domain Driven Design to move forward

## Phase 4: Long-Term Value (Persona: CTO and Architect)
### A problem-prevention culture: Well-architected and engineered systems.
Clean Architecture enabled (aka Hexagonal, or Core/Shell onion architecture)
separated in well-designed Bounded Contexts
Cloud ready from the beginning
RESTful APIs are the rule, HATEOAS inspired
performance oriented
CQRS (command and query segregation), then Event driven
### Keep a low carbon footprint: Sustainability.
faster, less memory imprint, less network overhead
cheaper to run 
easy to change
### Map the emerging value: Next-generation companies can see ahead.
keep the "Marginal Cost of the Next Feature" as low as possible
